            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">DawÅ«d Vermeulen </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Cape Town, South Africa.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently employed as a developer at g0g0's X roads.
            <br />
            I have pivoted my career from IT Business Operations to Software Development. The journey of self-taught development has been a long and rewarding one. With a thirst for learning and solving problems I am always looking to get my hands dirty.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>
